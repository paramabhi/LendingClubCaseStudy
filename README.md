# Project Name
Lending Club Case Study:
>We work for a consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. 
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. The data provided as a part of this case study contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
